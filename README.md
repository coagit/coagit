## Hola, bienvenido! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Aleksandar, I'm a software developer currently based in Valencia, Spain. In my past life I lived in Serbia, loved the food there but the sea and the sun prevailed.

I've been writting software for the last 15 years, mostly on the web, working across the stack.
One time I was even engaged as a part time devops engineer, I liked the learning but not quite my cup of tea though.
My primary programming language is Typescript, besides it I had brushes with various other languages like Python, Java, Ruby, C++ and other.

Besides programming, I like to play a good game of basketball or tennis, ride a motorcycle, fly drones and visit a good music festival.
